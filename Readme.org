#+TITLE: Chris Barrett's Emacs Config

My personal Emacs configuration. Requires Emacs 26 or later.

I don't really suggest anyone else uses my config as-is, since it's a personal
thing. It's probably most useful for cribbing ideas. :)

* Motivation

- Since I use Emacs for work, editor stability is very important to me.
- After using Spacemacs for a while, I wanted to go back to a slimmer setup that
  is easier to hack on when I need to integrate packages
- I've declared Emacs bankruptcy a few times. I know how to write one of these
  things. ;)

* General principles

- I use Evil
- I use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package installation, rather than package.el. It's legit.
- I use [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]] in various places to make things a bit prettier.
- I use Spacemacs-style commands under the =SPC= leader, although I use hydras
  instead of which-key.
- I've themed Emacs to remove most source code color highlighting.
  - I use font weight to represent syntax features, instead of colour
  - This makes flycheck error squiggles and other editor cues stand out more.
  - There's a toggle between light and dark colour themes, under =SPC t t=.

* Project Layout

In contrast with Spacemacs, this config uses =use-package= pretty directly.

- =init.el= :: Emacs' entrypoint for loading the config
- =config/= :: lisp configuration files, loosely grouped by functionality
- =lisp/= :: lisp packages the config depends on

I also put any sensitive config in a =personal-config.el= file, not in this repo.

* I want to use your config

No you don't!

Have a skim over the init.el and the other config files to get a sense of what's
around. See =config/config-basic-settings.el= for general quality of life
customisations for core Emacs features.
