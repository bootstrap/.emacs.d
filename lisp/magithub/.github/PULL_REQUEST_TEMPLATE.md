Thanks for contributing!  It's really appreciated :smile:

Here are some things to remember:

- In the past, commit messages have mentioned issues directly.  I've found this to be more trouble than it's worth -- especially when code goes under review and is edited and subsequently rebased.  Try to leave issue/PR references out of commit messages -- opting instead to use the PR body to link the necessary records in the bug tracker.

- If you're fixing a bug or implementing a new feature, add something to the appropriate `RelNotes/*.org` file.

- If it's a breaking change (i.e., it could reasonably break someone's configuration), document that in the release notes as well.
